    <h1>Australia State of the Environment 2016</h2>

      <p>The Australia state of the environment 2016 report has been prepared by independent experts using a range of best available information to support assessments of environmental condition, pressures, management effectiveness, resilience, risks and outlooks.</p>

      <p><a href="https://soe.environment.gov.au/how-why">READ MORE &rarr;</a></p>

      <p>State of Environment maps are powered by <a href="http://terria.io/">TerriaJS</a>, which is a library for building rich, web-based geospatial data explorers, used to drive platforms such as the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/">NationalMap</a>, the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/">Australian Renewable Energy Mapping Infrastructure (AREMI)</a> and the <a href="http://neii.gov.au/viewer/">National Environmental Information Infrastructure (NEII) Viewer</a>. It uses <a href="https://cesiumjs.org/">Cesium</a> and WebGL for a full 3D globe in the browser with no plugins. It can handle catalogs of thousands of layers, with dozens of geospatial file and web service types supported.
