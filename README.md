State of Environment Map
========================

This is a [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaJS) based map made to support the [Department of Environment and Energy](http://www.environment.gov.au/) report into the [State of the Environment 2016](https://soe.environment.gov.au/).

The map was made by [CSIRO Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/) in collaboration with the Department of Environment and Energy.
